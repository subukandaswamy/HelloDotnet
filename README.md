# HelloDotnet

This project implements the following algorithms:

- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
- [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
- [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
- [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) (Prime number Generation)
- [0-1 Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0-1_knapsack_problem)

## Warning

The best way to learn a programming language is to start working with it. One good way to master C# is to start implementing some famous algorithms using C#. This project is not to showcase the best possible way to implement the above algorithms. This is just an outcome of my own learning process. Even if I later learn a better way to implement the same, I may not have time to come back and improve this implementation. Use it at your own risk.
